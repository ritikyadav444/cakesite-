 <h4>We opened our shop in 2018, and that first day we sold out of every baked good by noon. 
 Over the last three years, we’ve learned a few things (like how to keep up with demand!),
 but are honored to still delight some of those very same customers.</h4>
<center> <h1>WE LOVE BEING A BAKERY</h1></center>
 <h4>To us, a bakery is everything that’s right with a neighborhood. 
 We love working dough in the early hours of the morning, the satisfyingly straight rows of baguette,
 and too-adorable-to-eat cupcakes. 
 We love putting smiles on the faces of little ones, prepping for the big meeting with a great breakfast,
 and giving an excuse to lingering with an old friend.</h4>
